# About

This is a commercial project I did while working at eStoreLabs. It was implemented on the e-retailer website called Apteka Melissa; you can find it [here](https://www.apteka-melissa.pl/essentiale).
And if that doesn't work, [here is the archived version](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp).

## Tech stack
* Bootstrap5 (custom, internal version)
* SASS
* JavaScript

## What I learned

### Quiz in JS

The main challenge was coding the quiz. Quiz only displays the correct answer, doesn't count any points.
There is also a button that resets the quiz and allows to go again through the questions.
I practiced generating content with JS and writing event handlers.

### Alt texts...

For this project the client is very particular about alt texts, they provide us with the alt text content and the element it should relate to. Quite often client's requirements do not align with best practices, but the client is unhinged.
This prompted me to write a blog post about alt texts for SEO and accessibility. You can read it on [Hashnode](https://witchwrites.hashnode.dev/the-importance-of-alt-texts-in-web-accessibility-and-seo).
